At the end of their first year at Telecom ParisTech, students participate in the "PAF": a 2-week programming challenge in which they utilise the skills developed throughout the year.

Our goal in this project was to automatically extract university affiliations from scientific publications with Machine Learning methods. Using these affiliations, we were able to trace the journey that post-docs entering and leaving Telecom ParisTech would take throughout their academic careers.

This tool was useful to the Social Sciences and Administration departments as it provided them with a way to supervise their researchers and oversee their career development.
