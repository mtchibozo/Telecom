# Grand Débat National Project

Antoine HABIS, Alexandre LANVIN, Maxime TCHIBOZO, Dimitri THEVENEAU

The Grand Débat National dataset is a public collection of French opinions containing millions of text entries. 

Our team used Latent Semantic Analysis methods to peform a hierarchical topic modelling of these text entries.


Throughout this project, our team sought to find a conclusive answer to the following question: Does the 'Grand Débat National' dataset reveal divisions and inequalities within the French population.

By extracting key topics from the dataset we were able to identify and analyze ideological, sociological, economic and geographical disparities within the French society.

The Grand Debat National dataset is too heavy to upload on GitHub, you may download it directly from:

The Dataset is completely public.
