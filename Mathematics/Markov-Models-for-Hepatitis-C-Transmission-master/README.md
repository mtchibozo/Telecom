# Markov Models

Markov Models to solve SIR differential equations and simulate Hepatits C transmission in an open environment.

This project contains both simulations and a publication poster I created for the 'A Markov Model For The Spread Of Hepatitis C Virus' paper by Coutin, Decreusefond and Dhersin.
